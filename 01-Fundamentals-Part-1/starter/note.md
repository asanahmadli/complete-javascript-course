keep variable names descriptive
let and const
in JS values can be object or can be primitive
primitives
number--used for decimals and integers
string--sequence of characters
boolean==logacl type true or false
undefined--value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (empty value). typeof of the value is undefined and value as well undefined
null--also means empty value
biginit--larger integers than the Number type can hold
JS has dynamic typing: We dont have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically. Values has type not a variable.
typeof operetor will give you type of the value
console.log(typeof 'asan')
string
typeof null is object
you cant reasign const variable
convert string to number use Number()
convert number to String use String()
if you cant convert to number it gives you NaN. which type is number but invalid number
in js only + contatinate strings rest of the operations automatically converts to numbers and make calculations.
use triple equal compare strictly
== type coercion
expression is part of statement
statement full sentence
